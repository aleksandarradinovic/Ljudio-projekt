# Vue Project - Ljudio

Project description: Building an small youtube application where the client will be able to
* Search for a specific song,
* Search for a specific artist,
* Choose a specific artist and view the artists songs,
* Play, pause, next, previous features for a user friendly experiance,
* See the video of the specific song on a youtube player,
* get a link for sharing specific artist / song

Project experiance: Now when the project is done and all the features works in the project i've got stronger knowledge about how to work with an API and how to fetch data from the different endpoints presented. Better anderstanding about the vue js framework and how the javascript framework works and how to approach an project.
